//! Stages 4–5 (06_AI_ENGINE.md §3) and the Offline Fallback (§10).
//!
//! `Synthesizer` is the one place that calls an `LlmProvider` and the
//! one place that runs the grounding check. Every capability module in
//! `capabilities/` goes through this — none of them talks to a provider
//! directly, so the degrade path (§10: cloud → local → template) and the
//! grounding check (§3 Stage 5) are enforced exactly once, not
//! reimplemented per capability.
//!
//! "If the LLM is unavailable, Athena must remain fully usable": this
//! module is why that's true structurally, not by convention.
//! `Synthesizer::synthesize` cannot return an error — the worst case is
//! `Recommendation::from_template`, always available, always grounded.
