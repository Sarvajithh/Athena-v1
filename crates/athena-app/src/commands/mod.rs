//! IPC commands. `get_app_version` below was S01's one health-check/
//! version round trip (SPRINT1_SPEC.md Objective 3); every command in
//! this crate is named as an imperative verb per Implementation Plan
//! §2.3. `integrations` (07_INTEGRATIONS.md) is the connector surface.
//! `ai` (06_AI_ENGINE.md) is the AI layer's surface — every command
//! there phrases a verdict `athena-domain` already computed, never
//! computes one of its own.

/// command living here rather than in a new file — `get_app_version`
/// above is this crate's existing precedent for a free command with no
/// dedicated module of its own, and Task 4's scope note restricts that
/// task to `keychain.rs` and `Cargo.toml`; this one extra line here (and
/// its registration in `main.rs`'s `generate_handler!`) is the minimal
/// exception needed so the frontend can actually surface Task 4's
/// required "stored locally, not in your OS keychain" notice — that
