/**
 * Settings — a fifth flat nav-rail destination hosting the AI provider
 * key-management surface (06_AI_ENGINE.md §9's `save/has/delete
 * *ApiKey` commands in `crates/athena-app/src/commands/ai.rs`, typed in
 * `ipc/bindings.ts` but previously called nowhere in the frontend).
 *
 * This is a route, not a `ModalLayer` addition: `ModalLayer.tsx`/
 * `modalContext.tsx` document exactly two named interruptive-surface
 * exceptions (`'challenge' | 'deep-work-guard'`, both typed into
 * `ActiveModal` itself) and call that set "a hard ceiling, not a
 * starting point" — key management is a persistent, revisitable
 * settings surface, not an interruption, so it doesn't fit that
 * layer's contract. No prior settings-style screen exists anywhere in
 * this codebase (`MissionStrip.tsx`'s doc comment notes there isn't
 * even a Profile-editing entry point yet), so this is a new,
 * intentionally minimal pattern: a flat screen, same shell as every
 * other route, no sub-navigation.
 *
 * Two providers are exposed, matching bindings.ts exactly: Anthropic
 * (cloud, paid) and Hugging Face (free-tier Inference API). Ollama, the
 * third provider `RecommendationDto.source` can report, requires no key
 * (it's a local install) and so has no panel here — nothing in
 * `ipc/bindings.ts` exposes an Ollama configuration command to call.
 *
 * This screen also hosts every account/OAuth data-source connector
 * (Codeforces, LeetCode, GitHub, Gmail, Google Classroom, Notion — see
 * `ConnectorsSection.tsx`), relocated here from Semester Setup's
 * wizard. An account connection is a standing relationship that should
 * persist across every future semester, not something re-prompted
 * inside a once-a-term wizard, so it lives in Settings instead. Only
 * Semester Setup's file-based import mechanisms (calendar/.ics, PDF,
 * CSV — see `SemesterSetup/ImportStep.tsx`) remain in the wizard.
