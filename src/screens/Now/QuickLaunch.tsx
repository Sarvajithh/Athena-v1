/**
 * Section 6 — Quick Launch (05_OS_HOME.md §9): the bottom of the
 * screen, deliberately the lowest-emphasis section — small text links,
 * never buttons or icons in a toolbar.
 *
 * The full spec lists six entries. Four of them ("Log a grade," "Log
 * DSA practice," "Log deep-work outcome," "Add a deadline") each write
 * one typed row directly — but their backing tables
 * (`grade_snapshots`, `dsa_practice_log`, `deep_work_sessions`) don't
 * exist in this schema, and this change is explicitly scoped not to
 * modify storage. Rather than wire a button to a write path that
 * doesn't exist, or invent a new modal (spec's own `ModalLayer` is
 * documented as "a hard ceiling, not a starting point" — exactly two
 * named exceptions, neither of which is a quick-capture form), only
 * the two entries that are pure navigation with "no data created" are
 * implemented here — which is also exactly how §9 itself describes
 * those two: "plain navigation, no data created."
